# Challenge-3

<br>

## Overview
In this weeks challange, we had to write a javascript code to have our page generate a random password for the user. This code will give the option to the user to choose on various criterias for the passwords like; length of characters, upper or lower case letters, symbols, and numbers.

<br>

## Pseudo code 

// create a prompt for ; length (should have 8-128)
// confirm- lowerCase. upperCase, numeric, specialCharacters
  // let numbers = confirm("do you want numbers");
  // consol.log(numbers);
  // let lowerCase = (confirm "do you want lower case letters?");
  // consol.log(lowerCase) ;
  // let upperCase = = confirm( do you want upper case letters?);
  // consol.log(upperCase);
// create var to hold answer to prompt/ confirm
// function to validate user answers
// if and equality operators
  // if(numbers){
    // true they want numbers create a random generator for the number variable
  // } else if { if they dont move one to the next prompt}
// list of numbers special characters etc
    // arrays
    // math.random to select random character from an array.
    // random choose characters
    // create a string equal to password var 
// generate random password
// return the password
